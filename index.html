            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p class = "dropdown-content active-content">There are kids today in this country who go without student lunches. Our
                mission is to bring that number down to <span class ="zero">zero</span>. We provide an efficient method for schools to broadcast the needs of 
                their students by declaring a monetary goal that they need to reach in order to provide lunches for any students that 
                may not have the necessary means to obtain one. </p>

            <h3>Values</h3>
            <p class = "dropdown-content">We believe every child has the right to a nutritious lunch. Food is not only vital
                to a child's learning capacity but lunchtime plays a vast role on a child's social interaction with other 
                students. Research demonstrates that school meal programs play an <span class= "important">important role</span> in supporting obesity prevention, 
                overall student health and academic achievement by improving childrenâ€™s diets and combatting hunger. </p>

            <p class = "dropdown-content">Displaying our need for donations is admitting that we have a problem with our
                current meal programs in school. We are constantly rallying for an increased funding for these programs but 
                until then we need your <span class ="help">help</span>.  Make a difference in a child's health and future by providing them with 
                necessities that need to succeed.</p>

            <p>According to USDA, the new regulations added 10 cents to the cost of preparing every school lunch and 27 cents 
                for every breakfast. To help schools meet the rules, Congress provided school meal programs 
                only 6 additional cents for each lunch and no additional funds for breakfast.  </p>

            <p>A study found that, on average, the full cost to produce a reimbursable school lunch was $2.91, exceeding the free lunch subsidy, which 
                at the time of the study was conducted, was $2.51. To boost operational revenue, many school meal programs rely on a la carte sales, 
                provide catering services or contract with community programs</p>

            <p>Children from families with incomes at or below 130% of the poverty level are eligible for free school meals. 
                Those with incomes between 130% and 185% of the poverty level are eligible for reduced price meals 
                (student pays 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch). For the 2018-19 school year, 130% of the poverty level 
                is $32,630 for a family of four and 185% is $46,435.</p>
